# ThrottleBlaster

A Pi Pico-based solution that reduces the effective frequency of fast CPUs by pulling down the STPCLK# pin at a specified frequency and duty-cycle.

This allows you to play speed-sensitive games, like Digger on a 1200MHz Athlon!

# How it works
The Throttle Blaster is a fancy PWM controller that pulls the CPU's STPCLK# to ground.

<img src='img/diagram.png' height=200 width=auto>

It is tailored to the needs of vintage PC enthusiasts, so it drives a 4-digit 7-segment display and is pre-loaded with presets that span several hardware generations.


# Features
- Three modes of operation to fit your needs, selected by jumpers:
  1. single push-button control. This is great for re-purposing the Turbo button (NOTE: the on/off turbo switch would need to be replaced with a push-button).
  2. rotary-encoder with a push-button. This is great for placing it on a drive bay panel.
  3. analogue potentiometer with/without a push-button. This could be used for configurations without a display.
- 7-segment TM1637-based display that shows the effective frequency. This can be considered optional, but is highly recommended.
- Cycle through preset frequencies or select a frequency at a 1MHz granularity.
- Each preset can be tuned/programmed both in terms of the PWM level but also the PWM frequency.
- Configuration changes are permanently stored in the Pico's flash memory.
- The PWM pulses are generated by the Pico's PIOs and are clock-accurate, with no jitter.


# Mode 1: Rotary Encoder (ROT)

- The devices starts at the "Presets" state (mode).
- Turn the knob to select a frequency
- Short push to switch to fine-grain frequency selection

## Initial configuration
- The default CPU frequency is 200MHz. Long push to configure the CPU speed. Select the frequency and short push to get back to the presets.

# Mode 2: Single-button (1Btn)

- The device starts at the "Presets" state.
- Three types of push:
  1. Short push (release immediately)
  2. Medium push (for ~0.5 seconds)
  3. Long push (about 2 seconds)
- Cycle through presets with a short push. A medium push brings us back to the default CPU frequency.
- Long push to enter programming mode.

# Mode 3: Two-button (2Btn)

- The device starts at the "Presets" state.
- Two types of push: long and short
- Three types of actions:
  1. Short Left or Right push (release immediately)
  2. Both Left and Right short push
  3. Both Left and Right long push.
- Cycle through presets with a L or R short push.
- Go to 1-1 manual mode with both L and R short push.
- Long push (L or R) to enter programming mode, or to configure the CPU Frequency (CPUF) when showing the maximum frequency.
- Reset to defaults by long press L and R twice.

# Mode 4: Potentiometer (POT)

- Can be used in conjunction with the single-button operation. Turning the potentiometer overrides the preset selected by the button.

# Firmware

## Dependencies
- (Optional) https://github.com/wahlencraft/TM1637-pico
- C++17 compiler

## Build Instructions
- Download release (v1.2.1) https://github.com/wahlencraft/TM1637-pico and extract it.
- `cd firmware/ && mkdir build && cd build`
- `cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DPICO_SDK_PATH=/path/to/pico-sdk/ -DPICO_TM1637_PATH=/path/to/TM1637-pico/ ../src/ && make`
- This will place the firmware into: `ThrottleBlaster.uf2` in the `build` directory.

## Installing the firmware
- Unplug the Pico
- Press and hold the small "BOOTSEL" button on the Pico
- While holding the BOOTSEL button, connect the Pico to your PC with a micro-USB cable
- The Pico should show up as a mass-storage device
- Copy the `ThrottleBlaster.uf2` firmware to the drive associated with the Pico
- Safely eject the mass-storage device

The Pico should boot and you should see the Pico's LED blinking.

# Circuit

## Schematic

<img src='img/schematic.png' alt="Throttle Blaster Schematic" height=240 width=auto>

The Throttle Blaster circuit is fairly simple:
- The Rotary Encoder, the Push Button and the Potentiometer are connected to the Pico's GPIOs.
- The Display is also connected directly to GPIOs
- The STPCLK# pin is driven by a N-channel MOSFET, a 2N7000, and its gate pin connects to the Pico's GPIO via a 1K resistor.
- The circuit is powered directly from the PSU's 5V power supply via diode (preferrably a Schottky).

- Select the operation mode using jumpers JP1/JP2.
- Connect J1 to your CPU's STPCLK# pin.
- Power it on and you are good to go.


## How to find the `STPCLK#` pin
Just look for it in your CPU's datasheet. 
This table lists the STPCLK# pin number for your reference:
